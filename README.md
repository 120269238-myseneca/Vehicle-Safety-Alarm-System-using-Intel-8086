Vehicle Safety Alarm System

 Overview
The Vehicle Safety Alarm System is designed to enhance vehicular safety, addressing a critical issue considering the millions of lives lost annually to road accidents. Using the Proteus CAD Software, I've simulated an 8086 microprocessor and interfaced it with a circuit. The core functionality revolves around a pressure plate. Once this plate detects the weight of a passenger, the system checks for both the seat belt's engagement and the door's lock status. If either is not secure, the system activates an alarm and an LED light as a warning.

Features

1. Pressure Plate Detection: Detects when someone sits in the seat, initiating the safety check.
2. Seat Belt Check: Verifies if the seat belt is engaged when a passenger is detected.
3. Door Lock Check: Validates if the door is securely locked when a passenger is present.
4. Alarm System: Sounds an alarm and illuminates an LED light if safety protocols aren't met.

Prerequisites
- Proteus CAD Software- Ensure you have the latest version installed.

 Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/sodeep/VehicleSafetyAlarmSystem.git
    
2. Open the project in Proteus CAD Software.

3. Run the simulation to observe the system's behavior when a weight is detected on the pressure plate and either the seat belt is disengaged or the door is unlocked.

4. Modify and experiment  with the provided source code to implement additional features or refine existing ones.
